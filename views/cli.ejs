<p>This command changes directory to the repository.</p>

<p>Lets pretend you need start a new node project</p>
<pre>

        cd 'reponame'
        npm install node
        node -v

And we can see that our version of node is 18.8.0</p>
<p>When developing is done and it needs to be pushed to the repository on github, use following command:</p>
<pre>
    Git add -a
    Git commit -m "commit message"
    git push
